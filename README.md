# Testing PyPlan on dev container

It works, but being PyPlan a github repo that is not updated from 2020... I don't know if I'll get replies in asking questions, like how to move the model folder in the workspace area of the dev container, so we can save the models and they won't be lost at each rebuild of the container.

Data source seems limited to csv files.

Can't find similar projects in the Open Source field... it seems that most of the projects are proprietary and focused on Dashboards or ERP instead of creating Models (either financial or business).
